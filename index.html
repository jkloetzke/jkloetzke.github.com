				PeerDrive is a open source file system to securely store, organize,
				share and sync your files from everywhere. It is built on a purely
				distributed peer-to-peer data model and will be a perfect solution
				when you need your data on different devices in different locations
				without relying on a permanent network connection or central
				infrastructure.
			</p>
			<p id="description">
				Currently PeerDrive is in the early alpha stage and hence
				(unless you're really brave) for <b>developers only</b>. The
				basic design is settled and there is a prototype implementation
				of the file system in Erlang. Mounting via FUSE/Dokan, network
				transparency and automatic synchronization/replication are
				roughly working.  Additionally some small GUI applications
				exist to demonstrate the full feature set.

			<h1>Explore the features</h1>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<td><h2>Store</h2></td>
					<td><p id="description">
						PeerDrive is mountable as a regular file system through
						FUSE and Dokan, thus supporting all major operating
						systems. All objects in PeerDrive are versioned so you
						never have to worry overwriting or loosing important data
						again. If the application is PeerDrive aware you even have
						to never save your work explicitly. A new version is
						created when you close a document or whenever you like.
					</p></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><h2>Sync</h2></td>
					<td><p id="description">
						All PeerDrive volumes can be synchronized directly,
						either locally or through the network. No central
						server or infrastructure is needed. The synchronization
						will just update documents which are shared between the
						volumes and that have been changed since the last
						synchronization. All types of conflicts are handled and
						no data will be lost because the objects history is
						always kept.
					</p></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><h2>Backup</h2></td>
					<td><p id="description">
						Backups are integrated seemlessly in PeerDrive and are
						just a matter of adding a synchronization rule. All new
						versions are forwarded to the backup volume and kept
						there forever. Optionally, very old versions can be
						deleted from the local volume to free disk space. The
						old versions of a file are instantly available as soon
						as the backup volume is mounted.
					</p></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><h2>Organize</h2></td>
					<td><p id="description">
						PeerDrive allows you to organize your files in
						arbitrary, non-hierarchical ways. The links between
						folders and files are location independent and work
						reliably across volume boundaries. Additionally any
						meta data, including links to other files, can be added
						to a file or folder.
					</p></td>
