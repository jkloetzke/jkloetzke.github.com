Get involved
============

PeerDrive is currently hosted on GitHub.

Project home: [htts://github.com/jkloetzke/peerdrive](http://github.com/jkloetzke/peerdrive)

Mailing list: [hotchpotch@freelists.org](mailto:hotchpotch@freelists.org) (the
projects former name, [archive](http://www.freelists.org/list/hotchpotch))

Download
========

Currently there are no binary packages yet. If you can help packaging PeerDrive
(e.g. Debian packages or writing an installer for Windows) then I'd love to
hear about it.
